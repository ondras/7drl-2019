<h2>Welcome, adventurer!</h2>
<p>An evil General Sibling Selector has locked you into his dreaded underground prison full of desperate beings and frontend developers. Getting away will not be easy! Several levels are awaiting, with a common goal: getting enough keys to advance further. Only the bravest and most patient might be able to survive.</p>

<h2>Before we begin...</h2>
<p>This is a game created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2019">7DRL Challenge 2019</a>. My initial plans were ambitious: I wanted to make a <a href="http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/">rotjs</a>-powered, hex-based, procedurally-generated, cross-browser, zero-install game with a rich story and immersive gameplay. I had ideas. I had courage. I had coffee. Unfortunately, I ran out of time.</p>

<p>So I decided to create something <a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p01gk35d.jpg">completely different</a>: a highly experimental web game that is built <em>only using HTML and CSS</em>. In particular, <strong>no JavaScript.</strong> Thus, an abomination was born. A game that is not really a game; a stupidly complex abuse of various technologies that Just Works&trade; and probably fits the required Roguelike genre.</p>

<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>Due to the highly simplified nature of the game (CSS is not the best tool for game development), the product comes pre-rated so that 7DRL judges can focus on more pressing matters. The following list summarizes various characteristics of the game &ndash; please align your expectations accordingly.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="ok"><strong>Procedural generation</strong> is available, so your experience will never be the same!</li>
	<li class="ko"><strong>Gameplay</strong> is severly limited to mouse/touch-based interaction. There are no vi-keys, no emacs-keys, no other-keys at all.</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<a href="<?php echo "?level=1&amp;seed={$seed}"; ?> "">Start the game!</a>
